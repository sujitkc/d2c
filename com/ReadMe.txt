First Set the location of the XML files appropriately in TestFeature.java file located in com/iiitb/test

Change this location : "C:\\Users\\Rohith Yogi\\Desktop\\d2c-master\\XML-Files\\Working_Blocks_test.xml" 

To run the test file use the following lines in the command prompt

javac com/iiitb/test/TestFeature.java

java com/iiitb/test.TestFeature

We get the Final ACCFG for all the blocks 
Only the Basicblocks are represented in the Final CFG displayed.
